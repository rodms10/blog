## Mozilla

I'm lucky enough to earn a living doing what I love. I've been fascinated by ordering computers around since I was a teenager. Growing up in the 90s this was a big deal!

Since February 2013 I've been working for mozilla on [Firefox for windows 8](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Windows_8_Integration). It's hard to see this as a job, it's really a community of people working together to keep the web open and free (as in speech).
